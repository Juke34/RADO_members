bio:
  Mathematician and PhD in Statistics from the University
  of Valencia, Spain in 2013.

  My research focuses on Bayesian methods and Spatial(-temporal)
  statistics applied to the interplay between life sciences and the environment.

  Held a postdoctoral position for 4 years at the French National Institute
  for Agricultural Research (INRA), working on Quantitative Genetics in forestry.
  I developed statistical models and software for the statistical analysis
  of forest genetic resources.

  Since october 2017, I work as a Biostatistician at the French agricultural
  research and international cooperation organization (Cirad),
  working mainly on animal epidemiology.
